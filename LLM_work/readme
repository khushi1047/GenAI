-> An LLM is an advanced AI model trained on massive amounts of text data so it can understand, generate, and reason with human language.
These models learn patterns in language—grammar, facts, context, and even reasoning—by predicting the next word (token) in a sequence.

-> A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on massive text data to understand and generate human-like language.

How does an LLM work?
1) Training on huge datasets (books, articles, code, web text).
2) Uses a Transformer neural network.
3) Learns relationships between words using attention mechanisms.
4) Generates responses based on probability and context.

Popular examples of LLMs : GPT models (like ChatGPT) , BERT , LLaMA , Claude , Gemini.

NOTE : a Pure LLM models predict the solution/response , they do not calculate it.

-> For the problems whose answer a Pure LLM model can't predict , it takes help of external tools.these external tools can be a python code,web search,etc.
-> an LLM model cannot run the code , it takes help from external sources for running the code.

NOTE : a Pure LLM model can only predict the response/answer , and it can only predict the answer for the questions related to the data on which it is trained.

-> “An LLM cannot answer real-time, private, future-certain, physically sensed, or ill-defined questions without external data or sufficient context.”

Q) why are API keys used?
ans) keys are used to track user activities.

NOTE : a Pure LLM model do not stores previous contexts , it answers the questions based on current context only.

-> the question you ask/prompt you give becomes the current context for your model.

-> when we chat with chatgpt/gemini or any AI model , and we ask a question in the current chat , then the current question along with all previous questions and their answers become the context for the current question , hence it remebers our previously given information and answers accordingly.(basically a History is maintained)

NOTE : when we interact with an LLM model using API keys , then it cannot use any External Tool.
